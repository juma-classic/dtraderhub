Media MIME types:* `*/*` (Specify a valid MIME type, rather than the literal `*/*` value. The literal `*/*` is only used to indicate that any valid MIME type can be uploaded. For more information, see [Google Workspace and Google Drive supported MIME

Apps should specify a file extension in the `name` property when inserting files with the API. For example, an operation to insert a JPEG file should specify something like `\"name\": \"cat.jpg\"` in the metadata. Subsequent `GET` requests include the
read-only `fileExtension` property populated with the extension originally specified in the `name` property. When a Google Drive user requests to download a file, or when the file is downloaded through the sync client, Drive builds a full filename (with
